# CPU Raytracer Project

## Overview

This project is a CPU raytracer designed to render stunning 3D scenes with realistic lighting and shadows. It leverages advanced algorithms and optimizations to deliver high-quality images efficiently. This project is built off of the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

## Key Features

- **Realistic Rendering**: Produces images with lifelike lighting, shadows, and reflections.
- **Advanced Acceleration Structures**: Utilizes BVH and other techniques to optimize rendering speed.
- **Modular Architecture**: Organized into distinct modules for flexibility and ease of maintenance.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed on the CPU with advanced math operations and modern C++ features.

## Project Structure

- **Source Code**: Organized into modules for acceleration, geometry, rendering, and more.
- **Assets**: Includes models, textures, and scenes for rendering.
- **Output**: Stores the rendered images in various formats.

## Build and Usage

The project is built using the Meson build system. After building, the executable can be used to render scenes, with output images saved in the `output/` directory.
